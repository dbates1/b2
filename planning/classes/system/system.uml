Interface System{

--public--
parse() //takes input stream, breaks into declarations, functions, etc., and calls *.parse() on each
eval()  //eval funcs and their gradients:  update prec on numbers, populate vars and pathvar, eval params, eval subfuncs (in order), eval funcs, eval Jv and Jp
eval_system() //system only
eval_Jacobian() //Jacobian only
get_precision()
set_precision()
get_number_functions()
get_number_variables()
//SOME FUNCTIONS RELATED TO SOLUTIONS

--private--
function *functions
function *subfunctions //user-defined functions should be handled as subfunctions
function *parameters  //depend only on pathvar (and numbers)

symbol *variables //symbol might not be the right name
symbol pathvariable
symbol *numbers

point *solutions  //stores all known solutions of system.  Perhaps not an array of points.  Might want more data stored directly with solutions, not at system level.
